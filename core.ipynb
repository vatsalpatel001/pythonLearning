    "### Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text on the web. It allows you to easily style and structure your content without using complex HTML tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key syntax elements in Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Headings: Precede a line with one to six hash (#) symbols to create headings, with one hash indicating the largest heading and six indicating the smallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   # Heading 1\n",
    "   ## Heading 2\n",
    "   ### Heading 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Emphasis: Surround text with asterisks (*) or underscores (_) to make it italic, or with double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__) to make it bold.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   *italic*\n",
    "   _italic_\n",
    "   **bold**\n",
    "   __bold__\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lists: Create unordered lists by starting each line with a hyphen (-), plus sign (+), or asterisk (*), or ordered lists by starting each line with a number followed by a period.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Item 1\n",
    "   - Item 2\n",
    "     - Subitem 1\n",
    "     - Subitem 2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Links: Enclose the display text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses to create clickable links.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   [Google](https://www.google.com)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Images: Similar to links, but with an exclamation mark (!) at the beginning. You can also add an optional alt text inside square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Code Blocks: Start a line with three backticks (```) to create a code block. You can optionally specify the programming language for syntax highlighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   \\```python\n",
    "   def hello_world():\n",
    "       print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   \\```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Inline Code: Surround code or variable names with backticks (`) to format them inline.\n",

    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Use the `print()` function to display output.\n",

    "   - The *args syntax is used when you want to pass a variable number of non-keyworded arguments to a function.\n",
    "   - The asterisk (*) before the parameter name (*args) allows you to pass any number of arguments to the function.\n",
    "   - Inside the function, the arguments passed using *args are treated as a tuple, which can be accessed and iterated over.\n",
    "   - It is conventionally named `args`, but you can choose any name you like.\n",

    "     ```python\n",
    "     def my_function(*args):\n",
    "         for arg in args:\n",
    "             print(arg)\n",

    "     my_function('a', 'b', 'c')  # Output: a b c\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **kwargs:\n",
    "   - The **kwargs syntax is used when you want to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function.\n",
    "   - The double asterisks (**) before the parameter name (**kwargs) allows you to pass any number of keyword arguments to the function.\n",
    "   - Inside the function, the keyword arguments passed using **kwargs are treated as a dictionary, which can be accessed and manipulated.\n",
    "   - It is conventionally named `kwargs`, but you can choose any name you like.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",

    "         for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",

    "     my_function(city='New York', country='USA')  # Output: city New York, country USA\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can use both *args and **kwargs in the same function definition, but the order should be *args followed by **kwargs. This allows the function to accept both non-keyworded and keyworded arguments simultaneously."

Inside the decorator, we define a wrapper function that invokes the original function. The wrapper function can contain additional code that executes before and after the original function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `decorator_function` simply adds print statements before and after calling the original function. When we apply the `@decorator_function` decorator to the `greet` function, the `greet` function gets enhanced with the additional functionality defined in the decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we call `greet(\"John\")`, the output will be:\n",

    "Hello, John!\n",
    "Decorator: After executing the function\n",
    "```\n",

    "- The `try` block contains the code that may raise an exception. It is mandatory and must be followed by at least one `except` or `finally` block.\n",
    "- The `except` block follows the `try` block and specifies the type of exception(s) that it can handle. You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different exception types. If any exception of the specified type occurs in the `try` block, it will be caught and the code inside the respective `except` block will be executed.\n",
    "- The `else` block is optional and is executed only if no exception occurred in the `try` block. It is typically used for code that should run when no exceptions are raised.\n",
    "- The `finally` block is also optional and is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is generally used for code that should be executed for cleanup or resource release purposes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 10 / 0  # This will throw a ZeroDivisionError\n",
